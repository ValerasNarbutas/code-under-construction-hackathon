# Use Case 3: Spec-Driven Development — Greenfield Application

Build a greenfield web application using specification-first methodology with AI-powered implementation.

## Objective

Design, build, and execute your own **spec-driven agentic workflow** — a set of custom agents, prompts, skills, and MCP server configurations — to brainstorm, specify, implement, test, and deploy a web application. Your team decides WHAT to build, chooses the spec-driven tooling, and defines HOW the AI agents orchestrate the process.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (for OpenSpec and Playwright)
- Python 3.12+ with uv (for Spec Kit)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot (or Codespaces)

### Azure Login (Required for Deployment)

If you plan to deploy your app to Azure, log in first using the credentials provided by the hackathon coaches:

```bash
az login
```

Verify you are on the correct subscription:

```bash
az account show --query "{name:name, id:id, tenantId:tenantId}" -o table
```

> **Important**: Confirm the displayed subscription and tenant with the hackathon coaches before deploying.

## Participant Guide

### Phase 1: Define What You Want to Build

Answer these questions as a team:

- [ ] **What application are you building?** (e.g., a task tracker, a recipe app, a dashboard)
- [ ] **Who are the users?** Define 3-5 user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] **What features are in scope for the MVP?** Keep it focused (3-5 core features)
- [ ] **What tech stack will you use?** (any web framework — React, Next.js, Vue, plain HTML/JS, etc.)
- [ ] **What data model do you need?** (entities, relationships, persistence)

### Phase 2: Define What You Need (Tools & MCP Servers)

Think about which tools and spec-driven methodology you'll use:

- [ ] **Which spec-driven tool will you use?**
  - **Spec Kit** (Python-based): `specify init --here --ai copilot`
    - Commands: `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`
  - **OpenSpec** (Node.js-based): `openspec init`
    - Commands: `/opsx:propose <idea>`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`
- [ ] **Which MCP servers do you need?**
  - Playwright MCP — for running E2E tests against your app
  - Azure MCP — for deploying to Azure (App Service, Static Web Apps, etc.)
- [ ] **Which skills do you need?**
  - The `find-skills` skill is already installed — use it to discover and install skills
  - Run `npx skills find <domain>` to discover
  - Install any you need with `npx skills add <owner/repo@skill>`
- [ ] **Configure your MCP servers** in `.vscode/mcp.json`

> **Important**: Run both Spec Kit and OpenSpec init from the **repo root**. They install prompts and agents that must be registered at the workspace root to be recognized.

### Phase 3: Execute the Spec-Driven Workflow (No Custom Agents/Prompts Yet)

After `spec-2-setup`, use the Spec Kit or OpenSpec commands for specify → implement → test → deploy.
Do **not** create custom prompts or custom agents unless you truly need to extend the workflow beyond those steps.

Run the workflow in order and verify each step:

1. **Brainstorm** — Run the brainstorm prompt. Verify user stories and acceptance criteria are defined
2. **Setup** — Initialize your spec-driven tool and discover relevant skills
3. **Specify** — Run your spec tool commands. Verify specs cover all core features
4. **Implement** — Run your spec tool commands. Verify the app runs locally
5. **Test** — Write and run Playwright E2E tests. Verify each user story
6. **Deploy** — Deploy using Azure MCP. Verify the app is live

### Phase 4: Verify & Iterate

Review the quality of your outputs:

- [ ] Does the app match the user stories and acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Do all Playwright E2E tests pass?
- [ ] Is the app running locally at `http://localhost:3000` (or similar)?
- [ ] Is the app deployed and accessible on Azure?
- [ ] Can you add a new feature by running the specify → implement → test cycle again?

## Feature Expansion

Add new features without git branches — use folder-based feature isolation:

### Spec Kit
```bash
export SPECIFY_FEATURE="new-feature-name"
/speckit.specify    # Specs scoped to this feature
/speckit.implement  # Implementation scoped to this feature
```

### OpenSpec
```
/opsx:propose "Description of the new feature"
/opsx:apply
```

Each feature follows the same cycle: **specify → implement → test → deploy**

## Copy/Paste Commands — Kanban Task Board (Drag-and-Drop)

Use these ready-to-paste sequences in **Copilot Chat**. Run terminal commands from the **repo root**.

### Spec Kit

**Copilot Chat**:
```
spec-1-brainstorm
We are building a Kanban-style task management app with drag-and-drop between columns.
```

**Terminal (repo root)**:
```bash
specify init --here --ai copilot
npx skills find "kanban drag and drop"
```

**Copilot Chat**:
```
Use Spec Kit. Create specs for a Kanban board with Backlog, In Progress, and Done columns.
Include drag-and-drop, task creation, editing, and persistence.
Then run /speckit.specify, /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, and /speckit.implement.
```

### OpenSpec

**Copilot Chat**:
```
spec-1-brainstorm
We are building a Kanban-style task management app with drag-and-drop between columns.
```

**Terminal (repo root)**:
```bash
openspec init
npx skills find "kanban drag and drop"
```

**Copilot Chat**:
```
Use OpenSpec. Propose and apply specs for a Kanban board with Backlog, In Progress, and Done columns.
Include drag-and-drop, task creation, editing, and persistence.
Then run /opsx:propose and /opsx:apply.
```

## Tips

- **Start small** — Focus on 3-5 core features for the MVP
- **Specs over code** — Spend more time writing good specs than fixing generated code
- **Test everything** — Write Playwright tests before adding new features
- **Local first** — Get it working locally before deploying to Azure
- **Iterate** — It's better to have 3 polished features than 10 broken ones
- **Build agents incrementally** — Create one agent, test it, then build the next
